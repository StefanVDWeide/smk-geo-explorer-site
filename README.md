# Denmark art explorer

## What is this project?
Denmark Art Explorer is an interactive website which let you start out with a random art object from the SMK with a specific topographical motive. It then fetches it's four nearest neighbors which you can click on to move through the country of Denmark while enjoying beautiful art!

## Are you affilated with the SMK?
No. I just like the museum and building websites with open API's. I did something similar for the Amsterdam Rijks Museum. You can check that project [here](https://randomrijks.com/)

## Where do you get the data?
The SMK has an API availble that anyone can use! You can find it here: [API Website](https://www.smk.dk/en/article/smk-api/)
